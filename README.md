THE TECH STACK USED

  The basis of any real - time video or chat application is based on server side communication for which I used Socket.io and as far as video call is 
  considered , amongst all options WebRTC was used in this project .
  Peerjs was used to accomplish the WebRTC functionaliy and hence allowing multiple users to view each other in a video call.
